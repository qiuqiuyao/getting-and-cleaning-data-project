##Codebook for tidydata.txt data set
### Identifiers
* subjected: id number for each subject in the experiment; factor variable range 1-30
* activityid: id number for six activities of daily living; factor variable range 1-6; 1=walking 2=walking_upstars 3=warlking_downstairs 4=sitting 5=standing 6=laying
